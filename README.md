# Network-Analysis
Social network analysis is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It characterizes networked structures in terms of nodes and the ties, edges, or links that connect them.


 1st Problem Statement: -
There are two dataset consists of information for the connecting routes and flight hault. Create network analytics model on both the datasets separately and measure degree Centrality, degree of closeness centrality and degree of in-between centrality respectively.
	
 important note 

•	Perform both R and python code for the above problem
•	Create network using edge list matrix: directed only
•	Columns to be used in R:

Flight_hault=c("ID","Name","City","Country","IATA_FAA","ICAO","Latitude","Longitude","Altitude","Time","DST","Tz database time")

connecting routes=c("flights", " ID", "main Airport”, “main Airport ID", "Destination ","Destination  ID","haults","machinary")
